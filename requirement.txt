Package and libraries to install in the creation of the environment to ensure the code works.

tensorflow     #Deep learnin package 
keras          #Deep learning / ease the use of tensorflow in perfoming deep learnin model
pandas         #Managing dataframe
seaborn        #more sophiticated graph
matplolib      # graph
scikit-learn   # machine learning  
numpy          # matrix computation
dash           # for the image creation
plotly         # for visualization
pillow         # for reading the ppm format of the images
glob           # searching acces path
pathlib
yaml           #for file configuration
base64         #for images transformation in base64
os             #operation system
pickle         #fir saving the SVM model


# By defaut keras is automacally installed when we install tensorflow
# And pandas appears to be automatically installed when install seaborn
#It appear tha seaborn preinstalls matplotlib too
